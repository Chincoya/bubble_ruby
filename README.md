# Advanced Building Blocks - Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is the first project in the Microverse's Ruby curriculum. It was divided into two parts: the first one was to build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns it sorted; the second,  very similar to the first, was to create a method called #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array by accepting a block using yield.
